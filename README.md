##clone_data_extension.html
This page allows you to copy a DE from one category (folder) to another. Particularly helpful when wanting to clone Synchronized DEs.

###To-dos:
- Fix the decimal-to-text hack I currently have in place.
- Add functionality to copy between BUs (not sure if this presently could work, needs to be tested)

##survey_lists_and_DEs.html
This page spits out JSON of all lists and DEs with as much info as I can reliably pull from the API. The output can be pasted into a JSON-to-CSV converter.

###To-dos:
- Convert the output to a table on the page, rather than CSV
- Get current counts of subscribers/rows
